## Issue

When [opening a new issue](https://github.com/reposcope/reposcope/issues/new/choose), you can choose an issue template and always make sure to fill out the issue template. 

### Bugs

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/reposcope/reposcope/issues) for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you are certain this is a new, unreported bug, you can submit a [bug report](https://github.com/reposcope/reposcope/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=).

- **One issue, one bug:** Please report a single bug per issue.
- **Provide reproduction steps:** List a step by step guide for reproducing the bug. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.

If you're only fixing a bug, it's fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend filing an issue detailing what you're fixing. This is helpful in case we don't accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.

### Feature requests

If you would like to request a new feature or enhancement but are not yet thinking about opening a pull request, you can submit a [feature request](https://github.com/reposcope/reposcope/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

## Development 

This is a pnpm monorepo. To run the website locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The web app will run at http://localhost:3001/ by default.

## Pull Request

If you find an issue you would like to fix or want to add a collection, any feature you think Reposcope should have, you can submit a pull request. You've invested a good chunk of time, and we appreciate it. We will do our best to work with you and get the PR looked at.

### PR Title Format

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Please add the scope of pull request as the title prefix like:

```
<scope>: what's changed.
```

The scope could be `config`, `web`, `docs`, `etl`, `scripts` and etc.

The various types of commits:
- `config`: a new collection, etc.
- `web`: a change about website, etc.
- `docs`: a change about documentation, etc.
- `etl`: a change about data pipeline, etc.
- `scripts`: a change about utility scripts, etc.

Do not get too stressed about PR titles, however. Your code is more important than conventions!

Example：
- Suppose you submit a new repository to the collection's configuration, your pull request title could be:
`config: add pingcap/tidb repo to open source database collection`

You can learn more about how to write a good Pull Request title and description in the [document](https://github.com/pingcap/community/blob/master/contributors/commit-message-pr-style.md).

## Add a collection

You can add a collection on Reposcope website by submitting PRs. 

The following is a file template for a collection that describes what you need to include.

Please create a `.yml` file under [the collections file path]( https://github.com/reposcope/reposcope/tree/main/configs/collections).

* File Name

`<collection_id>.<collection_name>.yml`, For example: `10013.game-engine.yml`

  💡 Tips: Please use `100XX` as your collection's id，and it should be `+1` after the latest submit in [here]( https://github.com/reposcope/reposcope/tree/main/configs/collections). 

* Content

```yml
id: <collection_id>
name: <collection_name>
items:
  - <repo_name_1>

```

You can validate your collection config locally before submitting:

```bash
node scripts/verify-collection.mjs --fix-suggestions
```

Here is a folder template for a blog provides guidance on the information you need to include.

Please create a folder under [`apps/docs/content/blog/`]( https://github.com/reposcope/reposcope/tree/main/apps/docs/content/blog), and create a `.md` file under the folder.

* Folder Name: describe the text briefly

For example: `deep-insight-into-programming-languages-2021`
